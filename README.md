   #### Expo Go

   After running these commands a new window in your browser will open up with information about project.

To use the simulators you first need to download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=Cj0KCQiAtrnuBRDXARIsABiN-7ANWy_2jX23GHocj9MWMcNmr1bs-ndjSYWDPBQ45cVrcptTbzlAgH0aAmqiEALw_wcB) and Xcode (from the app store).

   <i><b>Warning: If you are using Windows as an operating system you will not be able to download Xcode (due to Appleâ€™s restrictions).</b></i>
